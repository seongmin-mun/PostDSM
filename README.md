## Abstract
- The present study reports a computational simulation that shows the relation between context window and polysemy involving an adverbial postposition -(u)lo in Korean, a language typologically different from the major languages currently being investigated for this task. We employ Singular Value Decomposition in combination with Positive Pointwise Mutual Information, together with similarity-based estimation, to classify multiple functions engaging in this postposition, by manipulating the context window sizes from one to 10. Results from the simulation and visualisation showed (i) an advantage of a large context window size for overall classification performance, (ii) an asymmetry of the performance across the functions of the postposition, and (iii) a strong connection between words co-occurring with the postposition and its functions.
